        "question": "A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take? Options: (D) Refuse to dictate the operative report (C) Report the physician to the ethics committee (B) Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake (A) Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report",

It aligns with ethical standards in medicine, which advocate for full disclosure of errors that may affect patient care.\n\n2. **Option (B) Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake** - This option also supports the principle of transparency but involves confronting the attending physician directly. It may create tension in the resident-attending relationship.\n\n3. **Option (C) Report the physician to the ethics committee** - This option is more severe and may be seen as an escalation that could have significant repercussions for the attending physician. It may not be the first step in addressing the issue.\n\n4. **Option (D) Refuse to dictate the operative report** - This option indicates a refusal to comply with the attending's directive but does not directly address the need for patient disclosure.\n\nAfter considering the ethical implications and the importance of patient safety, the majority opinion among the agents would likely favor options that prioritize transparency and ethical responsibility.\n\nFinal Decision:\nAnswer: A) Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report."

His laboratory findings indicate elevated creatinine levels, leukocytosis, and a significantly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The renal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles.\n\nGiven these findings, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) **Renal papillary necrosis**: This condition is often associated with analgesic use (like NSAIDs), diabetes, and other factors, but it typically does not present with the specific findings of spindle-shaped vacuoles on biopsy.\n\n(B) **Cholesterol embolization**: This condition can occur after vascular procedures and is characterized by the presence of \"blue toe syndrome\" (mottled discoloration of the feet), acute kidney injury, and eosinophilia. The renal biopsy findings can also show vacuolar changes, which aligns with the spindle-shaped vacuoles noted in this case.\n\n(C) **Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis**: This condition typically presents with systemic symptoms, asthma, and eosinophilia, but the renal biopsy findings and the acute presentation post-cardiac procedure do not strongly support this diagnosis.\n\n(D) **Polyarteritis nodosa**: This is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the kidneys, but it usually presents with more systemic symptoms and does not typically show spindle-shaped vacuoles on renal biopsy.\n\nConsidering the recent cardiac procedure, the clinical presentation of mottled feet, acute kidney injury, and the biopsy findings, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is:\n\n**(B) Cholesterol embolization.**\n\nThis condition is consistent with the patient's recent history and the findings observed."
