Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can sometimes cause eye irritation, but it is not the primary cause of the current symptoms.\n4. **Occupation**: The patient works as an elementary school teacher, which may expose him to various allergens, including dust and pollen.\n5. **Physical Examination**: The examination shows bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge, which is consistent with allergic conjunctivitis.\n\nGiven these points, the most likely diagnosis is allergic conjunctivitis. The most appropriate treatment for allergic conjunctivitis is an antihistamine eye drop.\n\n**Answer**: (B) Ketotifen eye drops\n\nKetotifen is an antihistamine eye drop that can effectively relieve the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis by blocking histamine receptors and reducing inflammation."
