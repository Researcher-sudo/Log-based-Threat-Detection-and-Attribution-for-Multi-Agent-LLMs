{"role": "target", "direction": "in", "text": "Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques.

He is being considered for a new drug therapy that works by modulating certain proteins released from the heart in patients with heart failure. A drug called candoxatril is being investigated for its ability to inhibit the action of an endopeptidase that breaks down a vasodilatory mediator released from the heart, as well as, endothelin and bradykinin. This mediator is known to promote the excretion of sodium from the body and improve the ejection fraction. One of its side effects is its ability to increase angiotensin II levels which causes harm to patients with heart failure. Therefore, to improve efficacy and reduce its adverse effects, candoxatril has to be used in conjunction with angiotensin receptor blockers.
